# bin
Contents of my ~/bin folder

On OS X:
* Edit your /etc/paths file, and add '/Users/{username}/bin' at the top.  Note, '~/bin' will not work.
* Close and reopen your terminal.
* You will now be able to call any scripts in the folder.
* Make sure to add the execute flag to any scripts:  'chmod +x myscript.sh'
