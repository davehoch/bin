# bin
Contents of my ~/bin folder

On macOS:

* Edit your /etc/paths file, and add `/Users/{username}/bin` at the top.  Note, `~/bin` will not work.
* Close and reopen your terminal.
* You will now be able to call any scripts in the folder.
* Make sure to add the execute flag to any scripts: `chmod +x myscript.sh`

* [A decade of dotfiles](https://evanhahn.com/a-decade-of-dotfiles/) - especially the section on preferring scripts over aliases.
